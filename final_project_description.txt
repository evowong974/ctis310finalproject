CTIS 310 001:  
Advanced Computer Programming Spring 2023
9 May 2023

		For my ctis310finalproject, what I have accomplished is 
	 getting the majority of the program's base such as the 
	 Car subclass, the ElectricCar and GasolineCar subclasses, and the CarPanel class 
	 that extends the CarFX class. The next steps that will draw the final project closer to
	 its completion is mainly inputting code mainly in the CarPanel class such as an empty ArrayList that 
	 will be used to add and edit the user's data, Survey question labels, buttons that will act as the
	 add, edit, next, previous, and the calculate actions, as well as creating i
	 a method that will calculate the overall score for the car 
	 based on the scores given by the user. 
	 Depsite the lack of time, the program is not runnable yet 
	 nor has it come far as I planned it to.
	 I will do whatever I can and hope that the runnable program will be result in a good grade for end of 3 week.
